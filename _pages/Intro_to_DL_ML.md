This set of pages is written with the objective of providing a quick introductory base of knowledge about the given subjects. I specifically write these pages so that my undergraduate or master students understand most of the materials presented in my lab sessions or the papers used in our research projects better. 

Of course, these cannot be counted as a comprehensive source in the discussed subjects, but they are a good starting point for delving into the materials. 

We are engineers, and the spirit of these writings is to provide a just "what-is-needed-to-know?" type of source with the objective of using the materials in a given engineering application. So, I will just state the things which are needed. For example, on [this page](https://rezaym.github.io/DLML/Linear_Algebra), I am only stating the essential knowledge of Linear Algebra needed for simple machine learning and deep learning problems.

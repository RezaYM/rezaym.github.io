We know what vectors and matrices are. Just a set of numbers or objects juxtaposed in a one-dimensional or two-dimensional structures. Now if these numbers are put in three-dimensional or higher-dimensional structures, they are called tensors. We have the following notation:

Matrix  has  rows and  columns. the  row and  column of this matrix are shown with  respectively.
Tensor  is of dimensions . is the element of the tensor which is at coordinates . is a two-dimensional cut of the tensor.
I think we all are familiar with the transpose and multiplication operations on matrices. Also, the element-wise product operation of matrices which we show with .

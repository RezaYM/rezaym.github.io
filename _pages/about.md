I am Reza Yousefi Maragheh, a Ph.D. student in Industrial Engineering at Department of [Industrial & Enterprise Systems Engineering](https://ise.illinois.edu/) of [University of Illinois at Urabana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/). 

In my github webpage you will find the following:
* My [Resarch](https://rezaym.github.io/Research/) and my [Projects](https://rezaym.github.io/projects/); also my [CV](https://rezaym.github.io/cv/).
* Some introductary material in Machine Learning and Deep Learning for my undergraduate students are presented [here](https://rezaym.github.io/DLML/).
* Some introductary material in the use of optimization models in marketing, inventory, pricing, and manufactring for my undergraduate students. If you are a UIUC student and have a NetID, you can check my personal space in [wiki.illinois](https://wiki.illinois.edu/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=693819465) as well.
* The subjects and articles that I find interesting and useful from diverse areas of math and statistics. I try to narrate them in a more readable and fun theme so that you do not need much concentration while reading them.  [here](https://rezaym.github.io/year-archive/)

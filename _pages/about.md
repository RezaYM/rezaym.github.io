I am Reza Yousefi Maragheh, Senior Data Scientist at [Walmart Labs](https://www.linkedin.com/company/walmartglobaltech/about/)-Personalization Team. I got My Ph.D. in Industrial Engineering from University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). My Ph.D. thesis was on "Choice Modeling and Recommendation Optimization in Presence of Context Effects" supervised by Professor [Xin Chen](https://ise.illinois.edu/directory/profile/xinchen).

My Research interests:
  * Recommender Systems,
  * Optimization, 
  * Customer Intent Inference,
  * Pricing and Revenue Management.

In my github webpage you will find the following:
* My [Resarch](https://rezaym.github.io/Research/) and my [Projects](https://rezaym.github.io/projects/); also my [CV](https://rezaym.github.io/cv/).
* Some introductary material in Machine Learning and Deep Learning originally intended for undergraduate students at UIUC are presented [here](https://rezaym.github.io/DLML/). I have decided to continue this section in a blog format. 
* Some introductary material in the use of optimization models in marketing, inventory, pricing, and manufactring for my undergraduate students. If you are a UIUC student and have a NetID, you can check my personal space in [wiki.illinois](https://wiki.illinois.edu/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=693819465) as well.
* The subjects and articles that I find interesting and useful from diverse areas of math and statistics. I try to narrate them in a more readable and fun theme so that you do not need much concentration while reading them.  [here](https://rezaym.github.io/year-archive/)

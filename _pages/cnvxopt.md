### Convex Sets
## Basic Definitions
* *Affine Set*: A set $$C\subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$$ is affine if the line connecting two points in the set belongs to the set: If $$x_1, x_2 \in C$$, then, $$\theta x_1 + (1-\theta) x_2 \in C$$.


* *Affine combination of points*: $$\theta_1 x_1 + \theta_2 x_2 + \dots + \theta_k x_k$$ is the affine combination of points $$x_1, x_2, \dots, x_k$$, with $$\theta_1 + \theta_2 + \dots + \theta_k = 1$$.

* *Subspace*: is closed under sum and scalar multiplication.

## Part of Thesis Research: Learning the Shifts in Choice Patterns for a Data Set Including Transactions of Food Products

* Fitting, tuning, and evaluating different choice models including Multinomial Logistic Regression and its extensions, Mixed Choice Models, and Markov-Based Choice Scenarios is done using sklearn and pyomo.

* Shifts in demand patterns for different sets of choice options are measured by proposing and fitting a new model that incorporates context effects.

* Heterogeneity in customer types is explored by fitting different unsupervised learning methods. 

* Best fitted models are used to provide recommendations in inventory and pricing management by solving a Conic Quadratic optimization problem with Gurobi solver under pyomo.

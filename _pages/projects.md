### Learning the Shifts in Choice Patterns for a Data Set Including Transactions of Food Products (Part of Thesis Research): 
* Fitting and evaluating (using metrics like MRR, NDCG, $\chi^2$, KL) different ML models including Multinomial Logistic Regression and its extensions, Mixed Choice Models, and Markov-Based Models was done using sklearn and pyomo.
* Demand patterns by proposing and fitting new models incorporating context effects. Heterogeneity in customer types was explored using unsupervised learning models. 
* Optimal Recommendations were obtained by solving a Conic Quadratic optimization problem with Gurobi solver under pyomo Gorubi.

### Revenue per Click Optimization in Product Recommendation Modules in E-Commerce
* An ML model were designed which uses product's features and click/impression history to rank the candidates in given recommendation models,
* Assortment Optimization Problem (combinatorial) was solved in order to obtain the best set set for recommendations with max expected revenue per click. 

### Finding Global Optima of the likelihood function of Multinomial Logit Model (Equivalently Multinomial Logistic Regression)
* Tuning and performance comparison of *Gradient Descent*, *Coordinate Gradient Descent*, *Stochastic Gradient Descent*, *Barzilai-Borwein*, and *BFGS* methods was done.

### Near Optimal Hub-selection and Route Design; a Postal Company Case
* Mixed Integer Program was proposed to take into account timing, location, carrier constraints, and city demographics.
* Near-optimal solutions is provided by Linear relaxation to the problem.

### Choice Pattern Recognition for Online Customers of a Hotel Chain
* Different Supervised Learning models were fitted to infer and predict the purchase behavior of customers' room selection processes.
* The comparison made based on descriptive indices like AIC and BIC and Predictive Performance is measured by tests like the Chi-Square test.
* Demand sensitivity analysis to price changes is done and an algorithm for the optimal room price suggestion was proposed.

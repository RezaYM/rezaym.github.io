### Learning the Shifts in Choice Patterns for a Data Set Including Transactions of Food Products (Part of Thesis Research): 
* Fitting, tuning, and evaluating different choice models including Multinomial Logistic Regression and its extensions, Mixed Choice Models, and Markov-Based Choice Scenarios is done using sklearn and pyomo.
* Shifts in demand patterns for different sets of choice options are measured by proposing and fitting a new model that incorporates context effects.
* Heterogeneity in customer types is explored by fitting different unsupervised learning methods. 
* Best fitted models are used to provide recommendations in inventory and pricing management by solving a Conic Quadratic optimization problem with Gurobi solver under pyomo.

### Finding Global Optima of the likelihood function of Multinomial Logit Model (Equivalently Multinomial Logistic Regression)
* Tuning and performance comparison of *Gradient Descent*, *Coordinate Gradient Descent*, *Stochastic Gradient Descent*, *Barzilai-Borwein*, and *BFGS* methods is done.

### Near Optimal Hub-selection and Route Design; a Postal Company Case
* Mixed Integer Program is proposed to take into account timing, location, carrier constraints, and city demographics.
* Near-optimal solutions provided by Linear relaxation to the problem.

### Choice Pattern Recognition for Online Customers of a Hotel Chain
* Fitted different models and obtained the MLE.
* The comparison made based on descriptive indices like AIC and BIC and Predictive Performance is measured by tests like the Chi-Square test.
* With the fitted models, choice patterns are analyzed for different customer segments.
